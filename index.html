        <hr>
        <p><img src="images/Me.png" id="image" alt="placeholder">I am currently retired after a twenty year professional career in financial services. My specialization was centered around instututional trading operations and technology. After a four and
          half year personal sabbatical, I made the decision to pursue a second career in web developement.
        </p>
        <p>I have long been fascinated with all things tech. Particularly hardware (laptops and mobile devices). I'm a devote Apple consumer and I'm deep into their echo system. It wasn't until about this time last year that I started poking around under
          the hood. Meaning I wanted to understand how all the software I use works. This led to my decision to learn web and application developement.
        </p>
        <p>My passions are running; my Labrador Retreiver Taylor; running with Taylor and playing the guitar. I am quickly developing a fourth passion and that is learning to code.</p>
